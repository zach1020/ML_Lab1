## What is this?
- The Jupyter Notebook is a file that you can run Python in.
- The HTML file is simply the printed version of the Jupyter Notebook.
- We will be doing our work in Jupyter Notebooks, but I included the HTML just in case.

## How to make it work
1) Download the file
2) Unzip
3) Go to terminal, go to the directory that the file is in, and type `jupyter notebook`
4) Please include the Kaggle dataset folder in the same directory as the jupyter notebook.
5) Alternatively, you could change the Python import at the top of the document to include the path to YOUR dataset
